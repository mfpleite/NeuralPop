This package implements and showcases some of the methods detailed in the my [PhD thesis](https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/1545297/1/Thesis_ML_corrected_pdf_UCL.pdf).

The scripts TestParam4paperEI*.m run the simulations needed to yield the results presented in chapter 3 and are commented such that the parameters can be changed by a user.


Portions of the code are adapted and make use of functions from the SPM software http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/ and the following toolbox http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/34869-distance2curve?s_tid=srchtitle
